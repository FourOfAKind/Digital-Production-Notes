In programming, mathematical operators refer to symbols or functions used to perform calculations on numbers and numerical data. The most common mathematical operators include:
- Addition (+) 
    - Finds the sum of multiple numbers. To add numbers together, you must follow the syntax: num1+num2. 
        - For example: when sum = 5+9, sum = 14
- Subtraction (-) 
    - Finds the difference between multiple numbers. To subtract numbers, you must follow the syntax: num1-num2. 
        - For example: when difference = 7-9, difference = -2
- Multiplication `(*)` 
    - Finds the product of multiple numbers. To multiply numbers, you must follow the syntax: num1`*`num2
        - For example: when product = 5*8, product = 40
- Division (/) 
    - Finds the quotient of multiple numbers. To divide numbers, you must follow the syntax: num1/num2
        - For example: when quotient = 9/2, quotient = 4.5
- Floored division (//) 
    - Finds the quotient of multiple numbers, and rounds it down to the nearest ingeger. This follows the syntax num1//num2
        - For example: when int_quotient = 9//2, int_quotient = 4
- Modulus (%) 
    - Finds the remainder from a division. This follows the syntax: num1%num2
        - For example: when remainder = 9 % 2, remainder = 1
