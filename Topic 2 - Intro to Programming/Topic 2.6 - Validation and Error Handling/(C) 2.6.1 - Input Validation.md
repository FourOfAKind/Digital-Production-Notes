DISCLAIMER: the Python examples below assume that the variables (name, password, etc.) have been defined earlier in the program. When implementing validation, wrap the code in a while loop. I've not used while loops for conciseness. 

When writing programs, it is important to check that a user's input is valid to prevent errors or unexpected outcomes. Common input validation methods include:
- Presence Check
    - Ensuring that the user has entered an input.
        - An example of this would be making sure name isn't ""
        ```python
        if name != "":
            print("Name accepted. ")
        ```
- Length Check
    - Ensuring that a user's input is within a certain length range.
        - An example of this would be ensuring a user's password is longer than 8 characters, but less than 30
        ```python
        if len(password > 8) and len(password < 30):
            print("Password accepted. ")
        ```
- Type Check
    - Ensuring that the user's input is the correct type of data
        - An example of this would be ensuring that quantity is an integer
        ```python
        try:
            quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity of this item. "))
            print("Quantity accepted. ")
            # Converting a string to an integer will cause an error
            # We must use try and except to handle the error
        except:
            print("You did not enter a number. ")
        ```
- Format Check
    - Ensuring that the user's input is in the expected format
        - An example of this is ensuring an email address is in the format name@domain.com
        ```python
        if "@" in email_address and "." in email_address:
            print("Email is in the correct format")
        else:
            print("Email is not in the correct format")
        ```
- Range Check
    - Ensuring that the user's input is in the expected range
        - An example of this is ensuring age is between 1 and 125
        ```python
        if age > 1 and age < 125:
            print("Age accepted. ")
        ```
