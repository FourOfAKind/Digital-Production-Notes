Developing robust and reliable code is critical in software development. Robust code refers to code which can handle errors and rogue inputs. Reliable code refers to code which can handle unexpected errors or events. 

It is important to develop robust and reliable code to ensure that it functions as intended, even if the user makes a mistake or if there's a fault in the code. Robust and reliable code can also prevent malicious actors from exploiting vulnerabilities. To write robust and reliable code, we must:
- Plan and Design
    - Before writing code, it is important to plan, including how the user is intended do, and not intended to use it. 
- Thorough Testing 
    - Testing different types of data with varying quantity or accuracy (erroneous, invalid, valid) (see 2.8.5) is important to ensure that data is being rejected and accepted as expected. 
- Error Handling
    - Handling errors is critical to ensuring code is both reliable and robust. Software should handle errors gracefully, provide useful error messages, and log the error.

Creating robust and reliable code can help with managing:
- User error
- Exploits
- Code injections
