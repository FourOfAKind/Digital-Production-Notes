Accepted style conventions are guidelines for writing code which makes them more readable and maintainable. In Python, the accepted style convention is PEP8. Key aspects of PEP8 include:
- Code Layout
    - PEP8 provides recommendations for how to lay code out. This includes:
        - Use whitespace effectively
        - Indent code blocks with 4 spaces
        - Limit line length to 79 characters
- Naming Conventions
    - PEP8 recommends using descriptive and consistent names to make it easier for other developers to understand code's functionality and purpose. It also recommends using snake_case for:
        - Variables
        - Functions
        - Modules
    - And PascalCase for:
        - Classes
- Exceptions
    - PEP8 recommends using exceptions to handle errors to provide meaningful error messages which may help with debugging.
- Comments
    - PEP8 recommends using comments to explain complicated code sections and sections which require further context. Comments should always be:
        - Clear
        - Concise
        - Used only when needed
- Functions and Arguments
    - When using functions and arguments, PEP8 recommends that you:
        - Use default arguments sparingly
        - Use keywords as arguments when calling functions to make it more readable and self explanatory
            - This means that when calling a function using keyword arguments, such as:
            ```python
            def greet(message, name):
                print(message, name)
            ```
            - You will be calling it as:
            ```python
            greet(message="Hey", name="Jamie")
            ```
            - Instead of:
            ```
            greet("Hey", "Jamie")
