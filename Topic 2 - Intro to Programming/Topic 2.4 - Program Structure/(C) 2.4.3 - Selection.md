Selection (branching) refers to executing code and making decisions based off a certain condition. There are 2 main ways in which we can implement selection. 
- IF, ELSEIF / ELIF, ELSE statements
    - IF statements evaluate a condition. If the condition is true, the code is run. Otherwise, it is skipped. Here is an IF statement in Python:
        ```python
        if condition == True:
            print("Condition met")
        ```
    - ELSEIF / ELIF statements adds additional conditions and code to an IF statement which will be evaluated if the original IF statement is skipped. Here is an ELSEIF / ELIF statement in Python:
        ```python
        if condition1 == True:
            print("Condition 1 met. ")
        elif condition2 == True:
            print("Condition 2 met. ")
        ``` 
    - ELSE statement adds code to execute if no conditions are met. Here is an ELSE statement in Python:
        ```python
        if condition1 == True:
            print("Condition 1 met. ")
        elif condition2 == True:
            print("Condition 2 met. ")
        else:
            print("No condition met. ")
        ```
- SWITCH / MATCH and CASE statements
    - SWITCH / MATCH and CASE statements are like a shorter form of IF, ELSEIF / ELIF, and ELSE statements. SWITCH / MATCH sets the variable which is to be compared, CASE defines what to compare the variable to and what to do if the two values are the same. Here are SWITCH / MATCH and CASE statements in Python (versions 3.10 and later):
        ```python
        match x:
            case 1:
                # Occurs if x is equal to 1
                print("x is equal to 1")
            case 2:
                print("x is equal to 2")
            case _:
                # Occurs if x does not meet any other conditions
                print("x is not equal to 1 or 2")
        ```
