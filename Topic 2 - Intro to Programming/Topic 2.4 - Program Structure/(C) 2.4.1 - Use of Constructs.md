Sequence, selection, and iteration are fundamental concepts which are used in almost every program and algorithm. By understanding how constructs work, you can build more complex, efficient, and sophisticated algorithms and programs. These constructs include:
- Sequence
    - A set of instructions executed in a specific order. In programming, sequence refers to the order in which a set of statements are executed, line by line. 
- Selection (branching)
    - Executing different instructions based off a condition. In programming, selection usually uses if, elseif, and else statements. 
- Iteration 
    - Repeating instructions until a condition or number of repetitions are met. 
- Combining Constructs
    - Programs and algorithms will often combine these constructs to achieve more complex tasks.
