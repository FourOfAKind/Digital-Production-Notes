In programming, functions allow us to define code which we want to execute later in the program. They can massively reduce code redundancy as once they are defined, they can be used with one line of code. They can also make code more modular and easier to understand. 
- Declaring a Function
    - To declare a function, we need 4 pieces of information:
        - Function name
        - Arguments (data the function needs)
        - Function body (the code that the function will run)
        - Return data (this is optional, a function without return data is a procedure)
            ```python
            def function_name(argument1, argument2):
                # code to be ran
                return data
            ```
- Calling a Function
    - To call a function, we need 2 pieces of information
        - Function name (from the function we defined earlier)
        - Arguments (brackets are blank if there are no arguments)
            ```python
            function_name(value1, value2)
            ```
- Functions vs Procedures
    - Functions will always return data
    - Procedures do not return data (in Python and Psuedocode)
