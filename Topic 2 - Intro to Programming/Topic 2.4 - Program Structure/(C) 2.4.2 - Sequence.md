Sequence refers to the order in which a set of statements are executed, line by line. Being able to make use of sequence is essential for being able to write, understand, and debug code. To use sequence you must:
- Determine the most efficient and logical orders for actions within a process
    - When designing a process, it is important to consider the order in which actions are performed. This is so the process runs smoothly and produces expected outputs. 
        - For example, getting the sum of 2 outputs uses sequence, and the most appropriate order of actions would be:
            - Get inputs
            - Add inputs
            - Output results
- Understand the correct order of operations in calculations and processes
    - Programming involves a lot of calculations. When debugging, we may want to manually perform a calculation and compare it to the outputted result. This is to ensure the program is correctly calculating the result. 
        - For example, a programmer would need to know the correct order of operations to solve a calculation like:
             ```python
             result = num1 + (num2-num3) + num4 * num5
             ```
