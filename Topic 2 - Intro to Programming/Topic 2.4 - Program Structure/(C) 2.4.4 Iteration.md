Iteration refers to executing code repeatedly until a condition or number of repetitions is met. This can be done using FOR and WHILE loops. 
- FOR loops
    - Used to execute code a set number of times. Useful when we know how many times to repeat something. Here is a FOR loop in Python:
        ```python
        # Prints numbers from 1 to 5
        # range sets the starting and stopping values
        for i in range(1,6):
            print(i)
        ```
- WHILE loops
    - Used to execute code while a condition is met. Useful when we don't know how many times to repeat. Here is a WHILE loop in Python:
        ```python
        i = 0
        while i <= number:
            print(i)
            # i = i + 1
            i += 1
        ```
- BREAK / END
    - BREAK / END can be used to exit the current loop. It can be used with FOR and WHILE loops to iterate through code until a condition is met. Here is an example in Python:
        ```python
        # while True would loop infinitely until we say False or use break
        while True:
            passcode = input("Enter the passcode. ")
            if passcode == "5792":
                # Exits loop
                break
        ```
