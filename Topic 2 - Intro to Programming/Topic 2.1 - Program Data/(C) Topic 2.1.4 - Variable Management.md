In programming, variable management is very important for improving program readability and sustainability, which improves efficiency when developing or maintaining the program. Common variable management practices include:
- Appropriate Use of Global Variables
    - Global variables are used when multiple functions or procedures need access to the data. This saves memory, as it prevents you from needing to declare the same variable multiple times. 
- Appropriate Use of Local Variables
    - Local variables are used when only a specific function or procedure needs to access the data. This saves memory as the variable is only stored and used when the function is called. 
- Naming conventions
    - Naming conventions can help to differentiate between different value types assigned to program elements such as classes, functions, variables, etc. Examples of naming conventions include:
        - snake_case - Each word is in lower case and separated by an underscore. Used in variable and function names. 
        - camelCase - The first word is in lower case and every other word has the first letter capitalised. This is used in variables and function names. 
        - PascalCase - The first letter of each word is capitalised. Used in class names. 
        - UPPERCASE - all letters are in uppercase. Used in constants. 
- Appropriate / relevant names of values
