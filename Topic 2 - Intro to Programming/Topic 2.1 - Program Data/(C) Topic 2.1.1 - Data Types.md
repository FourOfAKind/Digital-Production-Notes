In programming, data types are needed to define how data should be processed and stored. The main data types include:
- String 
    - a sequence of characters used to store text such as names, addresses, or messages. Strings are often used to display human-readable information and all strings will start and end with quotation marks " ", or apostrophes ' '. You can use either, but not both. 
        - I.e. "Jeff", "6 London Drive, London", "Lorem Ipsum"
- Character 
    - A data type that represents a single letter, character, or symbol. 
        - I.e. "A", "1", "@"
- Boolean
    - A data type that can hold one of two values.
        - True, False
- Integer
    - A whole number which can be used in mathematical calculations or comparisons.
        - I.e. 309, 49, 7
- Float / Real / Double
    - A number containing a decimal point which can be used in mathematical calculations or comparisons.
        - I.e. 3.14, 6.02, 5.25
