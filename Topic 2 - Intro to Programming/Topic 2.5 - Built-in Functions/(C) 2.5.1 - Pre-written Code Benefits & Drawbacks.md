Pre-written code refers to code which has already been provided by the programming language. Using pre-written code has a number of benefits and drawbacks:
- Saves time
    - Using pre-written code saves time as it does not need to be written from scratch and is likely to have been thoroughly tested and hence be reliable.
- Increases efficiency
    - Pre-written code is often written by experts, meaning it is liklely to be more efficient than code written from scratch.
- Promotes best practice
    - As pre-written code is written by experts, it is likely that they will follow best practices and accepted style conventions. 
- Avoids reinvention
- Dependence
    - Depending on pre-written code may limit programming knowledge in certain areas.
- Licensing
    - Some pre-written code may use licenses which restrict distribution and use of the code. 
- Requirements
    - Pre-written code may not meet the requirements of a program or project, resulting in need for additional code or modification.
