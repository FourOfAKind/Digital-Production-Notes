Programming involves solving problems by writing code. This may involve writing code from scratch, but it may also involve using user-written or pre-written code. 
- User-written code
    - Code that has been written by a programmer to solve a specific problem. When making use of user-code, it is important to ensure code (both your code which uses the user-written code, and the user-written code itself) is well documented. There are 2 ways to implement user-written code:
        - Importing modules - to import a module in Python and access a function name from the module, follow this syntax:
            ```python
            import MyModule
            # Functions from modules are prefixed with the module name
            MyModule.function_name()
            ```
- Pre-written code
    - Code that is provided by Python itself, such as built-in functions and standard libraries which provide extra functionalities. 
        - Built-in functions do not need to be imported and can be accessed in the same way as any other function. For instance:
            ```python
            # Rounds this number to 2 decimal points
            round(5.666666, 2)
            ``` 
        - Libraries can be imported in the same way as user-written modules:
            ```python
            import math
            math.sqrt(4)
            ```
            - Examples of standard libraries in Python include:
                - math
                - datetime
                - os
                - string
