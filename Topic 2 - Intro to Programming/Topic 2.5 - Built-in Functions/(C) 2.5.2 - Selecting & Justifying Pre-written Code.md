Python is a programming language with a vast array of built-in functions and libraries. It is important to be able to select and justify the use of built-in libraries when solving a problem. 
- Selecting pre-written code
    - Gaining familiarity with Python
        - It is important to understand Python, as it makes it easier to identify the function / library we need.
    - Identifying the type of problem
        - Identifying the task / problem at hand makes it easier to select a library. For example, a problem involving mathematical calculations may use the math library whereas a problem requiring file input and output may use the os library. 
- Justifying use of pre-written code
    - Efficiency
    - Reliability
    - Avoids reinvention
