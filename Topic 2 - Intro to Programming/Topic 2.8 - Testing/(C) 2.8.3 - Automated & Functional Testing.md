In programming, automated and functional testing tools are importrant for efficiently testing that software meets functional requirements and works as expected. 
- Automated Testing Tools
    - Software or code which is designed to automatically generate and execute tests on digital systems and code to ensure that they function as expected. Automated testing can carry out quality assurance and other test types autonomously, including:
        - Unit testing
        - Integration testing
        - Security testing

| Advantages                               | Disadvantages                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------    |
| Runs repeated tasks without human  error | Cannot test end user experiences                                     
| Can generate a large number of user tests | Cannot effectively test visual elements

- Functional Testing Tools
    - A subset of automated testing tools which focuses on indentifying errors and defects to ensure that the program meets functional requirements and is behaving normally. This is achieved through automating actions such as:
        - Clicks
        - Keyboard actions
        - Selecting menu items
        - Inputting values

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|--------            | -------              |
| Ensures system works as expected in all scenarios | Requires skilled testers to identify relevant test scenarios
| Can identify subtle faults in a program | Cannot test non-functional requirements i.e. security
