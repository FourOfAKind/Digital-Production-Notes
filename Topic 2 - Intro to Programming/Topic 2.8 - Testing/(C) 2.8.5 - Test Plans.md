In programming, a test plan is a document which details the goals and objectives for testing a software or hardware product. It's important because it ensures issues aren't missed when testing and it allows stakeholders to understand test details.

To create an effective test plan, you must:
- Identify tests to be executed
    - Describe the parts of the system which need testing
- State the purpose of the tests
    - Inform testers and stakeholders on why the tests are needed
- Identify data to be used in tests
    - State what data should be inputted into each field. Test data should include:
        - Valid data (data that should be accepted)
        - Invalid data (data outside the program's expectations)
        - Valid extreme data (data on the boundary of what should be accepted)
        - Invalid extreme data (data on the boundary of what should be rejected)
        - Erroneous data (data that is incorrect or inconsistent, often of the wrong data type)
- Describing the expected results
    - This is so an issue can be raised, logged, or fixed if results do not match.
