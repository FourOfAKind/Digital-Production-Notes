In programming, root cause analysis is an important methodology used to find the root cause of problems and stop them from reoccurring or causing further problems. 
- What is it? (the five whys)
    - The five whys is an iterative and interrogative technique used to find causal factors by asking "why" repeatedly until we are able to identify the root cause. For example:
        - Problem: Car won't start.
            - Why?
        - The engine won't turn over.
            - Why?
        - The battery is dead.
            - Why?
        - Alternator won't charge the battery.
            - Why?
        - The alternator belt is worn out.
            - Why?
        - I forgot to replace it. 
            - Root cause
    - When to use it?
        - RCA should be used when an error, breakdown, or incident has occurred, which has caused disruption or other undesired outcomes to a service. 
    - How to use it?
        - Define the problem
        - Use the 5 whys to identify causal factors
        - Use the 5 whys to identify root cause
        - Refer to "What next?" below
    - What next?
        - Create a corrective action plan (how you will deal with the root cause)
        - Create a preventitive action plan (how the problem will be stopped from occurring again)
