In programming, file handling refers to the use of files to output and input data. File handling is important as it means we don't need to get data every time we run a program. File handling is used for:
- Outputting data
    - Programs may output user inputs and other program data to a file so that they can immediately read the data the next time the program is ran. 
- Inputting data
    - Programs may load previously outputted files to read data and assign/load variables.

In Python, files can be handled in 3 different modes:
- Read mode
    - No changes can be made to the file but the lines and contents of the file can be read and stored as variables. For example:
        
        ```
        file = open("fileName.txt", "r") # Opens fileName.txt in read mode
        thisLine = file.readline()
        file.close()
        ```
        - An error will occur if the file name or path doesn't exist. 
- Write mode
    - Allows for content to be written to a file. The file is overwritten every time the file is opened in writing mode. For example:
        ```
        name = input("Enter your name. ")
        file = open("audit.txt", "w") # Opens audit.txt in write mode
        file.write("Program last used by " + name)
        file.close()
        ```
        - A new file wil be created if the file does not exist.
- Append mode
    - Allows for content to be written to a file. New data is appended to the end of the file. For example:
        ```
        file = open("highScores.txt", "a") # Opens highScores.txt in append mode
        name = input("Enter your name. ")
        score = int(input("Enter your score. "))
        file.write(name + "," + score + "\n") # \n adds newline
        file.close()
        ```
        - A new file will be created if the file does not exist.
