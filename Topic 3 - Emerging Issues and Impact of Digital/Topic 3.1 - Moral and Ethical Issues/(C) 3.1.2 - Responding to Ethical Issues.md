Companies may use a variety of methods to respond to moral and ethical issues when developing and designing systems, including: 
- Use of guidelines from professional organisations
    - Professional organisations may release guidelines and codes to help individuals and companies resolve moral and ethical issues which arise. This also prevents unethical behaviour in the workplace.
- Strategic planning and decisions
    - Companies may establish a plan or process for identifying and resolving moral and ethical issues to provide guidance, steps, and a standardised approach to solving complex issues.
- Internal policy documents
    - Internal policy documents are rules and guidelines written by the organisation to guide work. The contents should:
        - State how to escalate concerns.
        - Provide guidance on the current situation.
        - Provide information about the current situation.
        - State when to seek external guidance. 
- Company culture
    - A company culture can help to resolve moral and ethical issues, or have the opposite effect. This is dependent on the company's culture and attitude towards ethical practice. 
- Whistleblowing
    - Making a protected disclosure to a higher authority (i.e. reporting wrongdoing to a manager)
        - A whistleblowing policy is important as it encourages a culture where wrongdoing is quickly addressed.
