Situational awareness is an important skill needed to maintain workplace safety and detect any risks or threats. Individuals may use a variety of techniques, including:
- Observing normal behaviour
    - This involves paying attention to patterns and norms in situations. This can help us to identify regular behaviour and any deivaitions from these norms. 
- Awareness of co-workers
    - This involves paying attention to co-workers and others around you. This can help to identify threats, issues, and behavioural changes which may be a cause for concern early on.
- Recognising changing or abnormal behaviour
    - Being able to identify when something is deviating from normal behaviour. This is especially important when changes in behaviour can indicate a threat or a cause for concern.
