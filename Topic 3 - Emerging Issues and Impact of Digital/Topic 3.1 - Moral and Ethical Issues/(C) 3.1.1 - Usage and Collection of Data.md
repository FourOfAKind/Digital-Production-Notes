Data collection and processing has improved business / product performance but the storage of certain data has angered stakeholders and caused challenges:
- Advantages
    - Personalisation
        - By collecting and analysing customer data, products and services can be personalised to meet the needs of different customers. 
    - Decision making
        - Collected data can provide insights which can assist decision making in businesses, improving performance.
    - Better products and services
        - By collecting and analysing data on how customers use a product or service, companies can improve products / services or create new ones which are better at meeting specific needs of customers. 

- Disadvantages
    - Privacy concerns
        - The methods by which data is collected may seem unneccessary, excessive, and intrusive, which may anger stakeholders. How this data is used and stored may also anger customers and stakeholders.
    - Fraudulent risks
        - Data breaches may expose personal and sensitive data, potentially leading to financial loss and identity theft. This can also result in legal penalties for non-compliance with data regulations and lawsuits from customers and stakeholders.
    - Compliance
        - Companies which store data must comply with legislation related to storage / use of personal data, which can be complex and costly. Fines for non-compliance are also incredibly costly.
