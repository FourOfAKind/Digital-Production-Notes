An increasing reliance on technology has caused many concerns to arise regarding environmental damage. Common concerns include:
- Manufacturing and using technology
    - The creation, distribution, and usage of technology requires finite resources. This can raise concerns about the reusability of technology and resources. 
        - This is because some of the resources used in technology are toxic, difficult to recycle, or harmful to the environment.
- Replacing technology
    - The amount of technology being prematurely discarded and replaced has increased in recent years. This is often to perceptions of technology becoming outdated or old fashioned.
        - Phones are replaced on average every 2.5 years.
        - Workstations are replaced on average every 4 years. 
- Running services
    - Many computers that run services (i.e. file servers, domain name servers, etc.) need to be constantly running, which consumes a significant amount of energy. 
- Pollution
    - Electronic waste, such as discarded phones, can end up in landfill where they may leak toxic chemicals which can contaminate the surrounding environment (i.e. water and soil).
