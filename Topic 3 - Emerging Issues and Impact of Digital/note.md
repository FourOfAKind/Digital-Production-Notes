You may notice that a there are a lot of different pages of notes considering there's only 4 topics. This is because 3.1.1 - Moral and Ethical Issues and 3.2.1 - Emerging Trends and Technologies are both guaranteed (happened every year so far) to contain a 9 marker on ANY bullet point, so it is important there's a lot of detail. 

Note that some impacts on individuals may also affect society and/or organisations, and the other ways around. However, to ensure notes aren't just the same page copy-pasted 3 times, I have tried to mention different key points for each page (individuals, organisations, society).

The definition for each emerging technology is in the impacts on individuals notes for each topic.
