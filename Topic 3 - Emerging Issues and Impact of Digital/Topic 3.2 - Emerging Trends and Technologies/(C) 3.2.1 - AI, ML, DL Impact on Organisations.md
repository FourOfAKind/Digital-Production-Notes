AI, ML and DL have the ability to impact organisations in several ways, including:
- Advantages
    - Automation 
        - AI can automate repetitive tasks, making employees available to focus on more critical problems and tasks.
    - Decision making
        - AI can assist in decision making by analysing data, recognising patterns, predicting future trends, and providing insights which can help to make business / operational decisions.
    - Fraud detection
        - ML can prevent fraud by analysing conversational data (i.e. SMS and email) and transactional data (i.e. amount, payee, time) to detect anomalies in communication or transactions indicative of fraudulent behaviour. 

- Disadvantages
    - Cost
        - The implementation of AI, ML, and DL technologies are often expensive as they may require significant investments in hardware, software, and staff.
    - Complexity
        - AI, ML, and DL are often complex technologies, meaning they are difficult to understand. This can make it difficult to implement and maintain technologies which use AI, ML, or DL.
    - Data quality
        - AI, ML, and DL algorithms require large amounts of data to train off. If the data veracity (quality, reliability, etc.) is poor, the results produced are also likely to be poor, unreliable, or inaccurate.
