VR (Virtual Reality) - a technology that has the ability to generate a 3D environment which can be interacted with. 

AR (Augmented Reality) - a technology that can overlay a computer generated image, environment, or other object onto an end user's view of the real world.

AR and VR can impact individuals in many ways:
- Advantages
    - Enhanced experiences
        - AR and VR can be used to enhance real world experiences by making them more immersive or interactive, and providing additional information.
    - Accessibility
        - AR and VR can be used to create experiences which are more accessible to people with disabilities. This may allow them to partake in activities or experiences which they cannot do in the real world.
    - Therapuetic application
        - AR and VR may be used in a therapeutic context for the treatment of certain conditions. For example, VR allows for immersive experiences, which may be used to provide exposure therapy and treat phobias, anxiety, or trauma. AR and VR can also serve as relaxation / distraction which can be used to treat anxiety or physical pain. 

- Disadvantages
    - Addiction and isolation
        - Due to the highly immersive nature of VR and AR experiences, individuals may spend high amounts of time in these experiences, potentially leading to addiction and isolation. 
    - Displacement of real experiences
        - If individuals use VR and AR excessively, they may become less motivated or interested in attending real-world experiences and events. This can impact physical and mental wellbeing. 
    - Health concerns
        - Prolonged usage of these technologies can cause physical discomfort such as motion sickness, strain, and nausea.
