IoT (Internet of Things) refers to a network of physical objects with technologies that can connect to and exchange with one another over a network connection.

The impacts of IoT on individuals include:
- Advantages
    - Convenience
        - IoT devices can automate routine tasks, improving convenience for individuals.
    - Health and safety 
        - IoT devices can help users to track and monitor health goals (i.e. sleep). IoT devices may also have sensors which detects hazards and danger (i.e. carbon monoxide).
    - Accessibility
        - IoT devices make services, products, and systems more accessible by connecting and interacting with other devices. For example, a voice assistant can turn on a light. This technology also improves accessibility for users with disabilities who may have found it difficult or impossible to interact with devices in the past.
- Disadvantages
    - Privacy concerns
        - IoT devices collect and transmit data about individuals. This may raise concerns about how this data is used, who has access to it, and data interception or breaches.
    - Cybersecurity concerns
        - IoT manufacturers will often prioritise ease of use over cybersecurity and secure practices, which leaves these devices vulnerable to cyber-attacks and makes the IoT device as a potential access point into the network. 
    - Dependence
        - As individuals become more independent on IoT devices, they may face challenges once the technology breaks.
