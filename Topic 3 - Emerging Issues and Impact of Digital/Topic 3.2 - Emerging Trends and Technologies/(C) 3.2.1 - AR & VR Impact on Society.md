AR and VR impacts society in many ways, including:
- Advantages
    - Education
        - AR and VR can be used to create educational experiences which are more immersive, interactive and engaging than traditional teaching methods. This can improve learning outcomes.
    - Reduced emissions
        - AR and VR can allow for experiences, such as exhibitions and attractions, to be toured virtually, which reduces emissions related to travel and transport. 
    - Enertainment
        - AR and VR have been used to create new and immersive forms of entertainment. 
    
- Disadvantages
    - Job displacement / restructuring
        - AR and VR can simulate real-world experiences, meaning that employees who provide such an experience may be laid off due to decreasing demand if they do not adapt to AR and VR.
    - Social disconnect
        - AR and VR can replace in-person experiences and/or be isolating, potentially leading to a decrease in social and face-to-face interactions and causing a social disconnect among society. 
    - Inequality 
        - AR and VR provide new areas for economic development and growth (i.e. creating and selling virtual experiences). However, access to these technologies may be restricted by supply, cost, and infrastructure to support these devices. This means that many people will be unable to make money off of or access these new technologies, causing inequality and digital divide.
