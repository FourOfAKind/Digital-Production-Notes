IoT also impacts organisations in many ways. This includes:
- Advantages
    - Decision making
        - IoT devices can help to make decisions based off data collected by IoT devices and sensors. 
    - Improved efficiency
        - IoT devices can automate and streamline tasks, reducing costs and improving efficiency. 
    - Predictive maintenance
        - IoT devices can collect and analyse data from sensors and other devices / equipment in real time. This data can be used to identify patterns and trends in performance, including anomalies. This allows for the prediction of malfunctions or breakdowns and scheduling of maintenance before that.

- Disadvantages
    - Security
        - IoT devices often have limited security, meaning they often serve as an access point into networks in the case of cyber-attacks. This may lead to unauthorised access of devices or data.
    - Integration
        - There is a lack of standardisation in IoT technology. This means there may be challenges when integrating technology from different manufacturers. This may cause complications, increase costs, and increase wait times. 
    - Financial problems
        - Purchasing and implementing IoT technology can be expensive, especially for smaller businesses. This can create financial challenge and reduce return on investment.
