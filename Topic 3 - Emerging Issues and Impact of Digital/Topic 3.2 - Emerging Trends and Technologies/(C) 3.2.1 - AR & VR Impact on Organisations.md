VR and AR can impact organisations in many ways, including:
- Advantages
    - Training
        - AR and VR may be used to provide training through interactive environments which can simulate realistic conditions and real scenarios in the workplace.
    - Planning
        - AR and VR can realistically simulate scenarios or solutions before they are implemented into the real world. 
    - Communication
        - AR and VR can allow people to meet and communicate in a virtual location, regardless of physical location.

- Disadvantages
    - Costs
        - AR and VR are still new, meaning they may cost a lot to purchase, implement, and maintain. 
    - Limited content
        - AR and VR require high quality and highly immersive content to be effective. Such content can be difficult to create and require specialist skills, meaning content has limited availability. This may decrease the usefulness of AR and VR systems.
    - Usage training
        - AR and VR require specific skills and knowledge to use effectively. Organisations may need to provide or pay for training for employees and stakeholders to use it to full potential.
