AI, ML, and DL have the ability to impact society in many ways:
- Advantages
    - Efficiency
        - AI and ML can learn and perform tasks quicker and more accurately than humans, boosting productivity.
    - Education
        - AI and ML can analyse student work and recognise student's learning patterns in addition to providing individual feedback and grading for students. AI and ML can also provide teaching resources and strategies based off learning patterns of students.
    - Access to information
        - AI and ML can be used to analyse data sets and relationships to provide insights which were previously unknown.

- Disadvantages
    - Job displacement
        - AI and automation are able to replace repetitive or routine jobs. This can lead to job loss for the employees doing these jobs, and make it more difficult to get a similar job due to decreasing demand. 
    - Bias
        - ML is only as good as the data it is trained on. If the data contains a bias or inaccuracy, the result is likely to reflect that.
    - Economic restructuring
        - The widespread adoption of AI, ML, and DL can make some industries obsolete and cause new indsustries to emerge.
            - For example, automated / AI chatbots and support may cause a decrease in demand for customer support but it may increase demands in fields such as machine learning and natural language processing (AI being able to understand and respond to human language).
