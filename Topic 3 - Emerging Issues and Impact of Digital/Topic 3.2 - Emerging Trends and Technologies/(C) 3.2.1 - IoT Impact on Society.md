IoT also impacts society in many ways. This includes:
- Advantages
    - Healthcare
        - IoT devices can help healthcare providers by allowing them to monitor patients remotely, which decreased readmissions and makes healthcare resources more available.
    - Public safety
        - IoT devices and sensors can be used in public safety such as emergency response systems (i.e. a smoke detector that warns residents and emergency responders). This can help to improve response times and public safety by warning them of the danger.
    - Reduced resource usage
        - IoT sensors can monitor resource usage (i.e. energy, water) in real time and use this information to optimise resource usage, which reduces resource waste and costs.

- Disadvantages
    - Job loss
        - IoT devices are capable of automating and performing some tasks, meaning the employees performing these tasks may lose their jobs and be replaced by this technology. 
    - Inequality 
        - Due to factors such as income (as IoT devices can be expensive) or lack of infrastructure, IoT devices may not be available to everyone. This may further the digital divide. 
    - Environmental impact
        - Some IoT devices need to be run constantly to be effective, meaning that they may consume a lot of energy. The manufacturing of IoT may also contain toxic or otherwise harmful materials. Both these factors can lead to environmental damage.
