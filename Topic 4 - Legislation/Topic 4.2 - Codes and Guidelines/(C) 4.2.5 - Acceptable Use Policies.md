Acceptable use policy (AUP) - a set of guidelines which outlines what a company deems as acceptable use of their IT systems. The purpose of an AUP is to set expectations for employee behaviour and prevent inappropriate behaviour when using company technology. An AUP is needed for:
- Establishing expectations
    - An AUP should define clear expectations of how computing resources should and should not be used. This reduces confusion about what is or isn't acceptable use.
- Defining accepted activities
    - An AUP should define how technology should be used by employees, for example:
        - Using company resources for work related tasks.
        - Using email and messaging for work related communication.
        - Conducting work related research.
        - Using company approved websites and software.
- Defining prohibited activites
    - An AUP should define activities which are prohibited on company resources, for example:
        - Accessing illegal content.
        - Using unauthorised scripts / programs.
        - Hacking.
        - Distributing or creating malware.
- Defining consequences
    - An AUP can protect against incidents or liabilities by forbidding activities which may cause this and outlining consequences if the AUP is breached. This may include:
        - Disciplinary action.
        - Termination of employment.
        - Legal action.
- Promoting security
    - An AUP can promote security by setting requirements and measures to keep systems safe. This may include:
        - Password requirements.
        - Software updates.
        - Incident reporting.
