Employers have the right to monitor use of digital technologies to ensure smooth operation, employee productivity, and safety of company resources.
- Monitoring electronic communications
    - Employers may monitor electronic communications such as emails, messages, and social media. This ensures employees aren't using company resources for personal use, which improves productivity. This also ensures all company and professional guidelines and conduct are being followed when communicating digitally.
- Secret monitoring
    - Employers may use hidden software to track employee activity and prevent malicious use of company resources (i.e. hacking, accessing illegal content). Software may include packet tracers, keyloggers, and browser history trackers. 
- Monitoring systems
    - Employers may use a range of systems to monitor employees' use of technologies. This may include workstations usage software, application usage software, etc. These systems can provide insights into employee productivity. 
- Employer's monitoring policies
    - Employers must inform employees of any monitoring taking place, unless this contradicts the point of the monitoring.
