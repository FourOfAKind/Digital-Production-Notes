Should organisations collect personal data, they must follow strict legislation regarding usage and collection of this data. In the UK, this is under the Data Protection Act (2018).
- Principles
    - Data must be processed, lawfully, fairly, and transparently.
    - Data must be used for specified, explicit purposes.
    - Data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary. 
    - Data must be accurate and kept up to date. 
    - Data must not be kept for any longer than necessary.
    - Data must be handled in a way that ensures appropriate security. 
    - Data must not be transferred outside the UK unless the country has similar measures in place.
- GDPR
    - The DPA is the UK's adaptation of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). This is because the UK is no longer in the EU, meaning the GDPR no longer is enforced in the UK, yet the UK must have similar legislation so data can be transferred to and stored there. The GDPR and DPA have similar principles and goals and the DPA supplements the GDPR, adding UK specific provisions and exclusions
- Marketing
    - Direct marketing 
        - A type of advertising aimed at a specific person. This does not need consent if by post.
    - Mass marketing
        - Advertising to a larger audience (i.e. TV or Radio advert), which often requires payment to whoever hosts the advertisement.
    - Using communication platforms (i.e. emails, SMS) require consent regardless of if it is direct or msass marketing.
