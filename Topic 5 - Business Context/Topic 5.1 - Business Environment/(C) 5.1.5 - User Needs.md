When developing a digital system, it is important to consider and meet user needs. To do this, we must consider multiple key factors:
- Appropriate Functionality 
    - The technology should meet the needs of users and be reliable. This can be achieved through the user research and feedback, as well as acceptance testing and thorough testing.
- Pain Points
    - Aspects of the program which make it frustrating or difficult for users. Reducing pain points is crucial for an easy and seamless experience. This can be achieved through user-testing and user-centered design. 
- Accessibility Considerations
    - Technology should be designed with consideration for people who may have disabilities or impairments. his can be achieved by following WCAG and and using assistive technologies, i.e. screen reader and closed captions. 
- Availability
    - Technology should be available when needed and not subject to downtime or disruption. This can be achieved through robust programs, redundant / resilient systems, and backups. 
- Compatibility
    - Technology should be usable with other systems and devices. This can be achieved through using standardised protocols and formats and testing on a range of devices. 
- User Experience
    - The technology should be designed with user experience and ease of use in mind. This can be achieved through user testing.
- Cultural Awareness and Diversity
    - Technology should be designed to be inclusive and respectful of all cultures and backgrounds.
