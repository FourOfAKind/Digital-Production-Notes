Digital technologies have become increasingly important for supporting the business needs of organisations, examples include:
- Automated stock / inventory control
    - Software
        - Used to track stock levels, record purchases, and track transactions. This information helps to monitor inventories and plan restocking to minimise disruption.
    - Hardware
        - RFID Trackers and IoT Devices can track items and update stock levels accordingly. Databases may also be used to store this information. 
    - The process between components
        - Input devices (RFID, barcode scanners, etc.) capture data and send it to the database, which will update it accordingly. The updated data including analytics and visualisations is outputted, often through a software. 
    - Communications
        - These systems often communicate through the internet and network connection. 
- Communication and collaboration with stakeholders
    - Traditional communication technologies
        - Emails, telecommunication, and video conferencing are widely used technologies due to their ease of use and the wide availability of these technologies. 
    - Cloud-based communications
        - Slack, teams, etc. are common cloud-based technologies that allow for real-time communication, collaboration, file sharing, etc.
