To understand the purpose of an organisation, we must understand the main sectors of the economy first:
- Private Sector
    - Organisations owned by individuals and driven by profit. 
- Public Sector
    - Bodies or Agencies owned by the government for the benefit of individuals and communities. 
- Third Sector
    - Organisations that run like like businesses, but profits are spent for benefits of individuals or communities. 

Organisations can be categorised into 2 main types:
- Organisations that provide a service:
    - Services are activites that benefit people without providing a tangible product or object. 
- Organisations that provide a product:
    - Physical objects which are available for consumer use.
