    - This may require staff training and/or cause disruption or downtime.

    - New systems (i.e. AI chatbot) can improve access to information and quickly resolve problems.
    - May anger stakeholders due to lack of human interaction when AI cannot help.
- Costs
    - Technical change may reduce long-term costs through improved efficiency, automation, etc.
    - This may require significant initial investment.
