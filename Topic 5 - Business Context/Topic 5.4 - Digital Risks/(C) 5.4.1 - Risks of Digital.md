Whilst digital has added significant value to businesses, it has also introduced multiple risks.
- Security breaches - when an authorised person/party gains access to sensitive or confidential information (i.e. trade secrets).
- Privacy breaches - when an individual's personal information is collected, accessed, or disclosed without consent. 
- Regulatory and non-compliance - when operations or guidelines do not comply with required legislation and laws. 
- System failure - when a digital system or technology stops functioning correctly, making it unable to cary out the intended task, often due to a software bug or hardware failure.
- Audience exclusion - when a product or service is not accessible to all groups, cultures, or invidiuals. 
- Emerging rival services - when competitors use new features offered by digital technologies, such as digital downloads, cloud services, and mobile versions to stay competitive and unique. 
- Rapid changes in technologies and trends.
