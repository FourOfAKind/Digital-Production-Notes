Providing products/services online or digitally has had many benefits for businesses and customers. 
- Improved Accessibility
    - Worldwide availability - time and location constraints can be overcome as users can purchase access to a product or service through an autonomous system, meaning you can purchase the product through an autonomous system and time and place do not matter.
    - No physical limitations - as the product is being bought digitally, it is not bound by limitations such as stock or storage.
- Reduced Costs
    - Reduced overheads - selling products digitally means that less money has to be spent on shipping, storage, etc.
    - Eliminates needs for intermediaries - digital provision of products/services allows for businesses to sell directly to customers, without needing middlemen, which reduces fees and improves profit. 
- Improved Satisfaction
    - Personalisation - digital technologies can be used to collect and analyse customer data and needs, in order to recommend the most relevant products/services, improving customer satisfaction.
