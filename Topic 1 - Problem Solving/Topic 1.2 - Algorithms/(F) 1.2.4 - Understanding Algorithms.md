1.2.4 Understand the purpose of a given algorithm (flowcharts, written descriptions, pseudocode, program code) and how the algorithm works.
```

- Understanding an algorithms purpose:
    + By understanding an algorithms purpose, it allows for you to imagine how it could be implemented to solve a problem.
    + It also allows you to find the algorithms scope, and the limitations of the algorithm. Allowing for you to find, or develop, a better algorithm.

- Algorithm representation
    + Algorithms can be represented in many different ways, including:
        * Flowcharts
        * Written descriptions
        * Pseudocode
        * Program code
    + Each of these representations have their own advantages and disadvantages, and are used for different purposes. <sup><sup><sup>(See [Topic 1.2.1 - Types of Algorithms](https://github.com/FourOfAKind/T-Level-Digital-Core-Notes/blob/main/Topic%201%20-%20Problem%20Solving/Topic%201.2%20-%20Algorithms/(C)%201.2.1%20-%20Types%20of%20Algorithms.md) for more information) </sup></sup></sup>

- Understanding an algorithm functionality
    + After understanding the purpose of an algorithm, it is also important to understand how the algorithm works.
    + This can be done by following the individual steps of the algorithm, and understanding what each step results in.
    + Allowing for you to have a deeper understanding of how it works, what inputs it requires, what outputs it produces, limitations, and how it could be improved.
