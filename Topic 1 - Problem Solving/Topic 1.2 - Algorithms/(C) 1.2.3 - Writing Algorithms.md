To write algorithms effectively, it is important to make use of programming constructs (including sequence, selection, and iteration):
- Sequence
    - The order in which instructions are executed in a program. Sequence involves breaking a task into a series of individual steps which will be executed in a specific order. To write algorithms using sequence, you must:
        - Identify steps in the task
        - List steps in an order of execution
        - Write instruction / description for each step
- Selection
    - Making a decision based off a condition. Selection involves writing code that will take different steps based off the outcome of the condition. To write algorithms using selection, you must:
        - Identify the condition to be checked
        - Write code to check the condition
        - Write code that will execute if the condition is true
        - Write code that will execute if the condition is false
- Iteration
    - Repeating steps multiple times until a condition or a counter is met. Iteration involves writing code that will be repeated, and any code that will happen before or after this. To write algorithms using iteration, you must:
        - Identify condition or number of times to repeat
        - Write code executed before iteration
        - Write code that will be iterated through
        - Write code after iteration
