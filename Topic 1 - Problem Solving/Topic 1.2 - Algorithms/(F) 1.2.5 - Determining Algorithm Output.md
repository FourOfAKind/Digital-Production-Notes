1.2.5 Be able to determine the correct output of an algorithm
```


- Determining the output of an algorithm requires ones to know what inputs the algorithm requires, and what outputs the algorithm produces along with the limitations of the algorithm.

- Along with this, is the process of verifying the output generated by an algorithm is accurate, valid and consistent with expected results.

- When verifying the output of an algorithm, there are various methods but in most cases will fall under one of the following categories:
    + Testing
        * Manual testing - Running the algorithm with sample inputs and comparing the output to the expected output.
        * Automated testing - Similar to manual testing, but automating the input and testing it against a larger sample set of inputs/outputs.
    
    + Debugging
        * The process of identifying and fixing errors/bugs in the algorithms code that may result in invalid or unexpected outputs.
    
    + Peer Review
        * The process of having another person review the algorithm and its code to identify any errors or bugs that may result in invalid or unexpected outputs.
