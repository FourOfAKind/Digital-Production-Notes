Different symbols in flowcharts (see 1.2.1 - Types of Algorithms) represent different processes in a solution or system. This can include shapes such as:
- ▭ - Process
- ◇ - Decision
- ▱ -  Input/Output Data
- → - Program Flow
- ⬭ - Start / End

To make a flowchart, the following steps must be followed:
- Identify the main steps
- Draw start, symbols / processes, end
- Use arrows to show the flow of steps
- Label each symbol with a (brief) description

To make psuedocode, the following steps must be followed:
- Identify the main steps
- Use programming-like syntax to represent each step
- Use indentation to represent the hierarchy of steps
- Add comments to explain decisions or processes

Due to limitations of markdown files, I cannot give an example of a flowchart but here's an example of psuedocode:

    Temperature = INT INPUT

    IF Temperature > 30 DO

        SEND "Stay Inside Today" TO DISPLAY

    END IF
