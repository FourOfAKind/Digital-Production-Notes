In problem solving, there are multiple approaches to simplifying a problem and finding the solution. This includes:
- Modularisation approach
    - The modularisation approach involves breaking a program down into smaller, independent parts known as modules. These modules can be developed, tested, and maintained independently of each other. These modules are then combined to make the final product. 
        - Often used in Agile methodology
- Bottom-up approach
    - The bottom-up approach starts with the simplest components and builds the program up from these components. Individual components are created first and are combined to make the final product. Bottom-up is often used when the end product is unknown. 
        - Often used in Agile methodology
- Top-down approach
    - The top-down approach involves breaking down a system into smaller components, and requires a complete understanding of the system being built. These smaller components are eventually combined to make the final product. 
        - Often used in Waterfall methodology
