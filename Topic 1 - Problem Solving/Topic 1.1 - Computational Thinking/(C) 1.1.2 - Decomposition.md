Decomposition is a problem solving technique that involves breaking down problems in order to make them easier to solve and manage. The main features of decomposition include:
- Identifying and describing the main features of the problem
    - Before a problem can be broken down further, it is important to understand the main components of the problem, and how they relate to each other. 
    - Some techniques for this include:
        - Brainstorming
        - Mindmapping
        - Root Cause Analysis (see 2.8.4)
- Breaking down problems into smaller parts
    - Once the problem has been identified, different techniques can be applied to resolve and manage the problem:
        - Chunking (grouping related items)
        - Hierarchical decomposition (breaking problem down into smaller sub-problems until it can't be decomposed)
        - Functional decomposition (breaking problem down into functional components which are then broken down further until it can no longer be decomposed)
