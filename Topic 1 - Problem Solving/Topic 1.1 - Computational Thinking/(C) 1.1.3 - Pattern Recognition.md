Pattern recognition is a problem solving technique which involves seeking out and identifying similarities in a problem, system, or process. This can help to simplify the resolution or understanding of a problem, process, or goal. The main features of pattern recognition include:
- Identifying and describing trends and similarities
    - This involves looking for common patterns, themes, relationships, etc. in systems, problems, and processes. Some of the common methods include:
        - Collecting / analysing data
        - Visualising data
        - Comparing data
- Identifying and describing common features
    - Identifying common features between problems and existing solutions allows for time to be saved. This is because we do not need to create a new solution, but instead adapt an existing one saving time. Some methods include:
        - Researching existing solutions / problems
        - Comparing problems / systems / solutions
        - Using information from different sources
- Making prediction and assumptions
    - Using identified patterns can allow us to make assumptions, simplifying the development process. Some methods include:
        - Extrapolating patterns from existing data
        - Inferring patterns
