Abstraction is a problem solving technique that involves the filtering of unnecessary details in order to focus on essential information needed to solve a problem. The main features of abstraction include:
- Identifying necessary information
    - The first step involves understanding what the problem is and what information is needed to solve the problem. Some techniques include:
        - Problem analysis
        - Brainstorming
        - Research
- Filtering out unnecessary details
    - This involves removing information that is not needed to solve the problem. Techniques include:
        - Focusing on key features
            - Separating any other information
- Creating layers of abstraction
    - What inputs are needed
    - What outputs will be expected
    - Items expected to vary
    - Items expected to remain constant
    - Key actions in the program
    - Repeated actions in the program
